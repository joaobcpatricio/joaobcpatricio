### Jo√£o Patr√≠cio üëã

I am a 26 years old M.Sc. Electronic and Telecommunications Engineer, an area that has always
awakened in me a great interest and curiosity since a young age. Both personally and professionally, it motivates
me to take part on challenging projects by developing technologies that have a positive impact in our world.
Some of the fields that interest me the most are all related to IoT that make our Cities Smart, from sensing
(Sensors) up to self-organized networks, the Automotive industry from embedded SW to
vehicular network mechanisms and the health industry. 

I started my carrear as a Software Developer at Robert [Bosch](https://www.bosch.com/) GmbH, where I developed bootloader projects.
Currently I am a Development Engineer at [northh medical GmbH](northh.de), where I take part in developing [smart-sync](https://www.northh.de/product), an MR compatible Doppler ultrasound system, which synchronizes the cardiac cycle with the image acquisition (‚ÄúGating‚Äù).

## Skills
**Languages**: C++, C#, Python, Java, Javascript, Shell Scripting.

**Embedded**: C, Assembly, Lauterbach, CANoe, vFlash.

**Web Dev**: MERN Stack (NodeJS, Express, REST APIs, MongoDB, SQL, etc).

**Data Science**: Python with NumPy,  Dash Plotly Dashboards, Pandas, Matplotliv, Seaborn.

## Research

### Institute of Telecommunications of Aveiro
**Student Researcher**

I have worked in partnership for my master‚Äôs thesis about
‚ÄúNetwork mechanisms for swarms of drones in aquatic sensing
environments‚Äù where I developed several network mechanisms under Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN), and also a phisical environment simulator for clusters of aquatic drones and data transmition that is available [here](https://github.com/joaobcpatricio/OPAQS).
