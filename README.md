### Jo√£o Patr√≠cio üëã

I am a 28 years old M.Sc. Electronic and Telecommunications Engineer, an area that has always awakened in me a great interest and curiosity since a young age. 
Taking part on challenging projects that have a positive impact in our world is my passion. 
Some of the fields that interest me the most are augmented and virtual reality, along with reality simulation, and all related to IoT that make our Cities Smart, from sensing (Sensors) up to self-organized networks.

Besides following the latest technologies and personal tech projects, on my free time I enjoy playing VR games, musical instruments, going to concerts, travelling, and watching TV series.

I started my carrear as a Software Developer at Robert [Bosch](https://www.bosch.com/) GmbH, where I developed bootloader projects for automotive vehicles.
I then moved to Germany as a Development Engineer at [northh medical GmbH](https://www.northh.de/), where I took part in developing [smart-sync](https://www.northh.de/smart-sync), an MR compatible Doppler ultrasound system, which synchronizes the cardiac cycle with the image acquisition (‚ÄúGating‚Äù). 
In late 2023, I enthusiastically embraced a new chapter as a Software Engineer at [Thales Simulation & Training AG](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/specific-solutions/training-simulation) in Switzerland, immersing myself in several dynamic projects centered around Virtual Simulators.

## Research

### Institute of Telecommunications of Aveiro
**Student Researcher**

I have worked in partnership for my master‚Äôs thesis about
‚ÄúNetwork mechanisms for swarms of drones in aquatic sensing
environments‚Äù where I developed several network mechanisms under Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN), and also a phisical environment simulator for clusters of aquatic drones and data transmition that is available [here](https://github.com/joaobcpatricio/OPAQS).
